# Building a RESTful API | Building a Web App GUI 

The project, on the main branch, has been discontinued. 

The divergences from the original Pirple's project were too consequential to be able to continue without refactoring the full code base.  
The original project has been realised four years prior to this one, and has a poor design and code quality.  
The project has been continued on the [pirple](https://github.com/Dyrits/WEB-APP-WITH-RESTFUL-API/tree/pirple) branch following the original one.

The original project can be found on the dedicated [repository](https://github.com/pirple/The-NodeJS-Master-Class/tree/master/Section%204).  
The project has been refactored and improved, and the code quality has been improved up to [[Page 3 - Create Session]](https://github.com/pirple/The-NodeJS-Master-Class/tree/master/Section%204/Page%203%20-%20Create%20Session).  
The [pirple](https://github.com/Dyrits/WEB-APP-WITH-RESTFUL-API/tree/pirple) branch, in this repository, starts back from [[Page 4 - Deleted Session]](https://github.com/pirple/The-NodeJS-Master-Class/tree/master/Section%204/Page%204%20-%20Deleted%20Session).
