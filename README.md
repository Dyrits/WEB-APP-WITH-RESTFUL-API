This project has been build as part of the Node.js Master Class, available on [Pirple](https://www.pirple.com/).

### Personal recommandations
I don't recommend to buy and take the course provided by [Pirple](https://www.pirple.com/).
This course was originally released in 2018. Since then, the Node.js platform and ecosystem has continued to evolve.

## General Information
This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js and a web application using a custom templating engine.


## Technologies and tools
This project has been build using Node.js without any dependency.

## Installation
Run `git checkout pirple` to switch to the [pirple](https://github.com/Dyrits/WEB-APP-WITH-RESTFUL-API/tree/pirple) branch.  
Run `npm start` to start the server.

## Status
The project has been completed on the [pirple](https://github.com/Dyrits/WEB-APP-WITH-RESTFUL-API/tree/pirple) branch. Check the changelog for more information.

### Changelog

The project, on the main branch, has been discontinued.

The divergences from the original Pirple's project were too consequential to be able to continue without refactoring the full code base.  
The original project has been realised four years prior to this one, and has a poor design and code quality.  
The project has been continued on the [pirple](https://github.com/Dyrits/WEB-APP-WITH-RESTFUL-API/tree/pirple) branch following the original one.

The original project can be found on the dedicated [repository](https://github.com/pirple/The-NodeJS-Master-Class/tree/master/Section%204).  
The project has been refactored and improved, and the code quality has been improved up to [[Page 3 - Create Session]](https://github.com/pirple/The-NodeJS-Master-Class/tree/master/Section%204/Page%203%20-%20Create%20Session).  
The [pirple](https://github.com/Dyrits/WEB-APP-WITH-RESTFUL-API/tree/pirple) branch, in this repository, starts back from [[Page 4 - Deleted Session]](https://github.com/pirple/The-NodeJS-Master-Class/tree/master/Section%204/Page%204%20-%20Deleted%20Session).
